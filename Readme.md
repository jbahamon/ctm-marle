Credits and Acknowledgements

- bga, for supporting me all this time.

- The Spriters Resource (http://www.spriters-resource.com) for the sprites. In particular,
  the sprites ripped by Tonberry2k were incredibly useful.

- The Chrono Compendium (http://chronocompendium.com), in particular the user Dirtie, for
  ripping the sound effects from Chrono Trigger and making them available to everyone.

- The guys at the Mugen Fighters Guild forum (http://mugenguild.com/forumx/index.php),
  for answering my questions and helping me learn. Their Code Library/Snippet Section rocks.

- POTS, as I read his characters' code whenever I had doubts. I used some of his code as a
  base for some moves/state controllers.

- Square (now Square-Enix) and the team that created Chrono Trigger, for making this
wonderful game.

- warusaki3, as I used some sounds extracted from one of its characters (though their use is
currently disabled).

- Elecbyte, of course, for creating the awesome fighting game engine that is MUGEN.

- And you...
