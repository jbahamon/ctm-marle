Marle is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version but it should be playable.

What's Missing:

- Reorganizing her commands to make her more of a zoning/turtle character. 
Possibly a complete rehaul.
- Specific character interactions (intros, winposes, double techs, maybe)
- 12p mode

## Moveset

Marle is supposed to be play as a projectile-based zoner. Many of her normal
attacks create projectiles, in addition to her special moves.

### Special Moves

- **Siren's Kiss**: `B, DB, D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Marle shoots a special bolt at the opponent. If it hits, the opponent will be 
frozen in place for a while. Qualifies as a throw for super armor purposes.

- **Provoke**: `B, D, DB, a/b/c` (Ground)

Marle freezes her body and taunts her opponent. If she is attacked while in this
state, she will coutner by creating an ice statue that hits her opponent, 
freezing them. This move cannot counter throws.

- **Aura**: `D, D, a/b/c` (Standing)

Requires 50 Power. Marle uses her healing powers on herself, recovering 10% of 
her total health.

- **Ice**: `(Hold) B, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Marle creates a slow-moving ice flame that moves toward the opponend and 
will freeze them on hit. The button pressed determines the flame's range and 
speed.

- **Ice Spike**: `F, DF, D, DB, B, a/b/c`(Ground)

Marle creates a rising ice spike in front of her. The button used determines 
the delay before it appears.

### Super Moves

- **Glacier Spikes**: `D, DB, B, D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Marle creates three ice spikes in front of her in quick 
succession.

- **Ice 2**: `D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Marle summons two huge chunks of ice that fall in 
front of her.

- **Guardia Soldiers**: `D, B, D, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Marle screams for help, knocking out her opponent. 
Soldiers come from offscreen and attack them. Qualifies as a throw.


### Special Mode

- **Haste**: `a+c` (Ground)

Requires 3000 Power. Marle casts Haste on herself, boosting her movement and 
attack speed. Her Power will decrease automatically: the mode ends when she runs
out of Power.

### Final Move

- **Freeze Completion**: `D, B, D, F + a/b/c` (Ground while Haste is active)

Spends all remaining Power. Marle channels Ice magic and create ice figures that
attack the opponent.
